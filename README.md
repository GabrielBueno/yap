## Yet Another Pong

This is another Pong clone, written in C and using SDL2, for experimentational purposes only

## Compiling (unix)

Install the SDL2 packages of your distribution's package manager. You'll also need to have gcc installed. Acomplishing this pre-requisites, just run:
`make`

## Compiling (windows)

The SDL2 libs and headers are already in this project. You'll need to have [mingw](http://www.mingw.org/) and [gcc](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Install_the_MinGW_GCC_Compiler_Suite) installed. After installing them, run:
`build.bat`
